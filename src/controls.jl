"""
    ControlMap

Alias for `Dict{Symbol,Any}`. Every event in an effect-chain pattern
carries one of these as its `value`. Keys are OSC param names
(`:s, :n, :gain, :lpf, ...`); values are anything `_osc_value` can
serialize (or that the user wants to pass through and will be dropped
with a warning at dispatch time).

"""
    ControlPattern

Alias for `Pattern{ControlMap}`. The result type of every effect helper.
"""
const ControlPattern = Pattern{ControlMap}

"""
    _symbol_to_control_map(sym) -> ControlMap

Lift a single `Pattern{Symbol}` event value into the ControlMap shape:
`:bd` → `{:s => :bd}`; `Symbol("bd:1")` → `{:s => :bd, :n => 1}`.

Used by `_lift_to_control` to bridge the legacy sample-name DSL with
the new effect DSL. The `:N` suffix split is what the K preview already
does (see `_WORD_RX` in tui_bindings.jl) — same convention, same parse.

"""
    _lift_to_control(p::Pattern{Symbol}) -> ControlPattern

Lift each event's symbol value into a ControlMap. Used by effect helpers
to accept either flavour of pattern transparently. Idempotent: lifting
an already-lifted pattern returns it unchanged (no nested wrapping).

    set(key::Symbol, val) -> (Pattern -> ControlPattern)

Curried setter: returns a function that maps a pattern into a
ControlPattern with `key => val` on every event. `set` is **always
overwrite** — a second `set(:key, ...)` in a chain replaces the
previous value entirely (no composition).

If `val` is itself a `Pattern`, see the `set(::Symbol, ::Pattern)`
method.
